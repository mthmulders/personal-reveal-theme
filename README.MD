# Personal Reveal.js theme

This repository contains my personal Reveal.js theme.
It is based purely on my own taste, or lack thereof.

## Contributing
If you like it, feel free, fork it!

If you don't like it, don't create a pull request to "fix" it.
Your taste and mine differ, and that's perfectly fine.
You can fork it and adapt it to match your taste.

Either way, I'd love to hear from you!
