# Personal Reveal.js theme

This repository contains my personal Reveal.js theme.
It is based purely on my own taste, or lack thereof.

## Contributing
If you like it, feel free, fork it!

If you don't like it, don't create a pull request to "fix" it.
Your taste and mine differ, and that's perfectly fine.
You can fork it and adapt it to match your taste.

Either way, I'd love to hear from you!

## Preview
The `preview/` directory contains a simple Reveal.js presentation to showcase the theme.
It contains slides with code, with a mathematical equation, with a quote...

To use it, first run `npm i`, since it links to the Reveal.js package that is downloaded using npm.
Then, run the following two commands:
1. `npm run dev` in the project root
1. `serve -s` in the `preview/` directory

And access http://localhost:5000/ in your favourite browser.
