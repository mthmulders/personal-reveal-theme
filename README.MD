# I'm Blue Reveal.js theme

This is a blueish Reveal.js theme.
It is based purely on my own taste, or lack thereof.
There's a live preview available [here](https://mthmulders.github.io/reveal-theme-im-blue/), which is continuously updated.

## Contributing
If you like it, feel free, fork it!
If you use it and find something missing or not working as expected, please send me pull request.

If you don't like it, don't create a pull request to "fix" it.
Your taste and mine differ, and that's perfectly fine.
You can fork it and adapt it to match your taste.

That's not to be arrogant, it's just a matter of setting expectations...
Either way, I'd love to hear from you!

## Preview
The `preview/` directory contains a simple Reveal.js presentation to showcase the theme.
It contains slides with code, with a mathematical equation, with a quote...

To use it, first run `npm i`, since it links to the Reveal.js package that is downloaded using npm.
Then, run the following two commands:
1. `npm run dev` in the project root

Your browser should open the preview slide deck automatically.
